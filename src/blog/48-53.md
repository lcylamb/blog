# 52 Can you describe a complex problem you had to solve?

Sure, here's an example of a complex problem I had to solve:

During my previous job, I faced a thorny problem, which was that a large amount of data needed to be displayed on a page at the same time, and these data needed to be updated in real time. Initially, I used the traditional way to load and display data, but when the amount of data increased, the performance of the page became very poor, and even situations of lagging and crashing occurred.

To solve this problem, I began to look for more effective solutions. I studied some front-end technologies, such as virtual scrolling and pagination loading, and finally I chose the virtual scrolling technology to optimize the page performance. The virtual scrolling technology can only render the data in the currently visible area instead of rendering all the data at once, thereby greatly improving the performance and response speed of the page.

Through this example, I learned how to look for more effective solutions when facing complex problems, and constantly learn and explore new technologies to improve my ability.

# 53 What was your most significant accomplishment in your previous job?

One of my most significant accomplishments in my previous job was successfully implementing a new project management system for the company.

I worked closely with the project team to ensure that the new system was implemented smoothly and efficiently, and that the team was able to adapt to the changes quickly.I was able to successfully implement the new project management system, which resulted in increased efficiency and productivity for the team, as well as improved communication and collaboration.
