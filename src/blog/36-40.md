# 36 How do you minimize the risk of errors in your work?

I think the most important thing is to constantly check your work,it is a very effective way to minimize the risk of errors and prevent mistakes. After I finish writing the code, I will test the function myself first to make sure that it meets the expectations.
I will also try to use tools to help me check the code.
For example, I will use linter to check the code for syntax errors and style errors. I will also use unit testing to test the code to make sure that it meets the requirements.

Of course, sometimes there are some extreme cases that I did not consider and did not test, and I will collect these problems and summarize them into a document so that I will not make mistakes the next time I do a similar function.

# 37 How do you deal with stress?

I think the most important thing is to adjust your mindset. A bad mindset will greatly affect your work efficiency.
Last month, I worked overtime every week. Customers kept putting forward new requirements. We had meetings every Friday night to confirm the requirements. Then we had to complete them on Saturday. The test engineers would test again on Sunday. If there were bugs, we had to work overtime. So I was under a lot of pressure. At that time, I relaxed myself by running and daydreaming to adjust my mindset. When that stage was over, I went hiking and took a walk by the sea to relax myself.

# 38 How do you plan to ensure you complete a number of tasks effectively?

I will first determine the importance and urgency of the tasks and prioritize them. Prioritize the most important and urgent tasks.
Secondly, make a detailed plan for each task, including the steps, time estimate, and required resources.
Then arrange time reasonably, make a schedule, and focus on completing the current task.
Also, try to avoid handling too many tasks at the same time, as this may lead to distraction and reduced efficiency.
Finally, maintain a good state, pay attention to rest and maintain a good working state. Proper rest can improve work efficiency,

# 39 What was the biggest change you had to deal with in your previous employment? How did you handle it?

The biggest change in my previous job was the change in my sense of ownership. In the beginning, my role on a project was usually participant, and I thought that only a supervisor could be a project leader. But then my supervisor gradually put me in charge of a whole project, which surprised me, and he believed in me and always encouraged me. So far I have been responsible for five projects, including two large ones. I am very grateful to my supervisor for giving me such an opportunity to learn how to complete a project independently

# 40 How do you build relationships with other members of your team?

I think the most important thing is to be friendly and approachable.

I will try to listen to other people's opinions and try to understand their perspective. I will also try to be helpful and try to assist others when they need it. I will also try to be open and honest with my colleagues and try to build trust with them.

I will also try to be patient and understanding with my colleagues and try to help them when they are facing difficulties. I will also try to be flexible and try to adapt to the needs of my colleagues and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

in conclusionï¼ŒI think it's easiest to put yourself in the other person's shoes. You just have to think about what kind of person you want your colleagues to be
