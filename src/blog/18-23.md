# 18 Can you give an example of a time that you solved a problem?

# 你能举一个你解决问题的例子吗

In a project, I was responsible for developing a mobile application.
During the development process, I encountered a problem, namely the compatibility issue of the application on certain devices.
The application interface displayed abnormally on some devices, or some functions could not be used normally. To solve this problem, I first checked the application's code to ensure that no incompatible APIs or technologies were used.
Then, I used some compatibility testing tools to test the compatibility of the application on different devices. Through these tests, I discovered some compatibility issues and took corresponding measures to solve them.
For example, I adjusted the layout of the application to adapt to devices with different screen sizes. I also fixed some compatibility issues in the code to ensure the normal operation of the application on different devices.
In this example, the problem I encountered was the compatibility issue of the application on certain devices, and the measures I took were checking the code, using compatibility testing tools, and solving the compatibility issues.

# 19 Can you give an example of a time when you experienced difficulty at work?

# 19 你能举一个你在工作中遇到困难的例子吗

In a project, I faced a thorny problem, which was that a large amount of data needed to be displayed simultaneously on a page, and these data needed to be updated in real time. Initially, I used the traditional way to load and display data, but when the amount of data increased, the performance of the page became very poor, and even situations of lagging and crashing occurred.

To solve this problem, I began to look for more effective solutions. I studied some front-end technologies, such as virtual scrolling and pagination loading, and finally chose the virtual scrolling technology to optimize the page performance. The virtual scrolling technology can only render the data in the currently visible area instead of rendering all the data at once, thereby greatly improving the performance and response speed of the page.

Through this example, I learned how to look for more effective solutions when facing complex problems, and constantly learn and explore new technologies to improve my ability.

# 20 Can you tell me about a time that you disagreed with your supervisor ?

# 20 你能告诉我一个你不同意你的上司的例子吗

In the last project, my supervisor suggested that I implement the function of a module in the system, but I disagreed. The function of this module was very complex, and a colleague had already done a similar function before. Considering the tight time, I suggested that the colleague be responsible for this part of the work, while I focused on other modules to improve overall efficiency. In the end, my supervisor accepted my suggestion.

# 21 What would you do if you have a bad boss?

I would first try to communicate my concerns and suggestions to my boss in a professional and constructive manner.
