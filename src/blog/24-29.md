# 28 What is your definition of failure?

Failure is not the end of the road, but rather a stepping stone to success. It's an opportunity to learn from our mistakes, grow as individuals, and improve our skills and knowledge. Failure is a natural part of the learning process, and it's important to view it as an opportunity for growth and development.

failure can have multiple definitions. The following are some possible viewpoints:

- Failing to meet expected goals: If a project or task fails to achieve the set goals, such as incomplete functions, poor user experience, or serious errors, this may be regarded as failure.
- Inability to solve technical difficulties: Encountering insurmountable technical challenges that result in the inability to achieve the expected functionality or performance requirements can also be seen as failure.
- Excessive time and resource consumption: If a project exceeds the budget or time limit, it may be considered a failure because it means that resources were not managed effectively.
- Poor user feedback: If users are dissatisfied with the product and provide a large amount of negative feedback, this may indicate problems in the development process and thus be regarded as failure.

However, failure is not the end but an opportunity to learn and grow. Lessons can be drawn from failure, methods can be improved, and skills can be enhanced to avoid similar problems in the future. It is important to maintain a positive attitude and view failure as a stepping stone to success.

# 29 How do you set your job goals?.

I set my job goals by first understanding my strengths and weaknesses, and then identifying areas where I want to grow and develop. I also consider my career aspirations and the long-term goals of my company. I set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, and I regularly track my progress and adjust my goals as needed. I also seek feedback from my colleagues and supervisors, and I use this feedback to help me improve and achieve my goals. I also stay motivated by setting realistic goals and celebrating my achievements, both big and small.
