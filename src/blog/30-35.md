# 30 How do you deal with deadlines on multiple tasks?

I encountered this situation some time ago. I was responsible for 5 projects at the same time, and each project was approaching the deadline. I told myself to calm down and think about how to deal with it.

First, prioritize the tasks and evaluate the importance and urgency of all tasks. Categorize them into high priority, medium priority, and low priority, and then focus on high priority tasks.

Secondly, make a plan. For each task, make a detailed plan and schedule. Determine the key steps and completion time of each task to ensure that it can be completed before the deadline.

After I analyzed the tasks, I thought that some parts needed to seek support from colleagues or team members. Assigning tasks or asking for help can help reduce the workload and complete the work faster.

Then, avoid distractions when handling tasks and focus on the tasks currently in progress. At that time, I didn't take a break even during lunch break

# 31 Tell me about a time you led or worked in a team

In my previous position, I was a front-end development engineer. I developed insurance products in an insurance company, and my responsibility was to develop insurance systems.

For front-end development, performance optimization is an issue worth discussing, we need to give users the fastest time to load the page and provide a smooth experience.

Through our continuous summary and practice, our team has concluded the parts that can be optimized and improved for the insurance product system, which is our result

# 32 Describe a situation where you solved a problem

OIn a project, I faced a thorny problem, which was that a large amount of data needed to be displayed on a page at the same time, and these data needed to be updated in real time. Initially, I used the traditional way to load and display data, but when the amount of data increased, the performance of the page became very poor, and even situations of lagging and crashing occurred.

To solve this problem, I began to look for more effective solutions. I studied some front-end technologies, such as virtual scrolling and pagination loading, and finally I chose the virtual scrolling technology to optimize the page performance. The virtual scrolling technology can only render the data in the currently visible area instead of rendering all the data at once, thereby greatly improving the performance and response speed of the page.

Through this example, I learned how to look for more effective solutions when facing complex problems, and constantly learn and explore new technologies to improve my ability.

# 33 Describe a situation where you showed leadership

In a previous project, we faced time constraints and complex technical challenges. As a member of the project team, although I was not the team leader, I demonstrated my leadership in the process.

Whenever I encountered difficulties, I always actively contributed my ideas and suggestions to help solve the problems encountered by team members
I also actively communicated with relevant colleagues, and my supervisor recognized my approach very much.
Therefore, I was responsible for the most difficult part of the entire project and became a key member of the project.
Finally, I was responsible for maintaining the entire project

# 34 Give an example of a time when you spearheaded a project

I was in charge of a project that had a strict timeline . We needed to complete development and testing within two months and deliver it to the customer on time.

First, I organized a team meeting to clarify the goals, requirements and timeline of the project. We established the roles and responsibilities of each member

When assigning tasks, I considered everyone's skills and interests, and I would ask for everyone's opinions before assigning work. My supervisor would also ask for our opinions in advance when assigning tasks, which I think is a good way.

During the project, I regularly checked with team members to see how the progress was and whether adjustments were needed.

In the end, we successfully delivered the project on time.

# 35 Describe a time when you made a mistake in your work

Once, while developing a new feature, I made a mistake.
I misunderstood the requirements, usually we implement features based on product documentation.
At that point, both the backend developer and I misunderstood the requirements, and we agreed that our understanding was reasonable. However, the end result did not meet the customer's expectations. This led to us having to reconvene the meeting to discuss in depth and confirm the requirements.

This experience deeply taught me the need to thoroughly understand the requirements of a project before starting work.
